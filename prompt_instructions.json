    "closing_instruction": "Using the anomalies, frictions, and contradictions implied by the project info provided, generate a standalone diegetic artefact that extrapolates their implications into a speculative scenario. The artefact should NOT directly reference the prior analysis but instead embody its logic through diegetic form. Consider the possibility of anthropomorphising the artefact itself with its own voice if appropriate to the artefact category. Show, don't tell â€” leaving space for multiple readings or interpretations, supporting continued exploration and discussion. Make inferences, think step by step. Be synthetic. Leave an open door."
